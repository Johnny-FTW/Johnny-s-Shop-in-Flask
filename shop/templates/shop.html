        <p class="lead text-center mb-5">In antiquity, marketplaces and fairs were established to facilitate the
            exchange of goods and services. People would shop for goods at a regular market in nearby towns.
            However, the transient nature of stalls and stall-holders meant the consumers needed to make careful
            inspection of goods prior to purchase. In ancient Greece, the agora served as a marketplace where merchants
            kept stalls or shops to sell their goods</p>
